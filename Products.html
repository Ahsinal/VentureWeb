                <p>
                    Town Development Funds (TDF) is an autonomous financing institution established by the Government of
                    Nepal (GoN) in 1989 with a long term institutional objective of becoming a self-sustaining and
                    complementary part of intergovernmental fiscal transfer system. The TDF is the only financial
                    autonomous intermediary institution in the country presently providing debt financing to local
                    governments. Several donor agencies, including the GiZ, the KfW, the ADB, and the World Bank have
                    worked with TDF since its inception. Local governments in Nepal, especially municipalities and fast
                    growing emerging towns, are its main clients. The GoN, especially, the MoF and the NPC, view it is a
                    key institution that has an important role to play in the urban infrastructure development of the
                    country. TDF finances long-term urban infrastructure development projects through its loan and grant
                    funding.
